## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
Monitor morning digests to confirm memos appear correctly. If working, consider Phase 4 (real-time pings) or adding more discovery sources (Reddit, GitHub Trending).

### Key Files
- `src/lib/digest/index.ts` - Digest orchestrator (pulls memos)
- `src/lib/digest/generator.ts` - Script generator (weaves in discoveries)
- `src/inngest/functions/discover.ts` - Discovery cron (runs every 6h)

### Kickoff Message
v2 flow tested and working: HN search finds articles based on interests, stores as memos, digest pulls pending memos. Matt has 6 pending memos, Brandon has 3. Next digest should include "Molly's discoveries" section. Check digest logs to confirm, then consider Phase 4 or additional sources.
