# Session: 2026-01-25_1922

## Focus
Delete/edit UI, X/Twitter support, codebase audit

## What Was Done
- Added delete button to item cards (in expanded details, with confirmation)
- Added inline title editing (pencil icon on hover, Enter/Escape/blur to save/cancel)
- Added X/Twitter source type support:
  - Detect x.com and twitter.com URLs
  - Fetch tweet text via oembed API (no auth required)
  - Resolve t.co shortlinks to get actual GitHub URLs
  - Extract GitHub repos from tweets
- Fixed X processor: initial version only captured partial tweet text due to regex issue
- Ran comprehensive codebase audit (10 dimensions)

## Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| 0ad7e10 | Add delete and edit title UI for items |
| 1aae4aa | Add X/Twitter support |
| e8d1441 | Fix X processor: parse full tweet text and resolve t.co links |

## Tech Debt Identified
- [ ] Zero test coverage - add Vitest and test critical paths - High
- [ ] page.tsx is 301 lines, should extract ItemCard/FilterBar components - Medium
- [ ] In-memory rate limiter resets on serverless cold starts - Low
- [ ] Duplicate signature verification code (Node.js + Edge runtime) - Low

## CLAUDE.md Updates Needed
None

## Next Session

### Suggested Focus
Add test infrastructure (Vitest) and write first tests for `src/lib/processors/detect.ts` and `src/lib/security.ts`. These are pure functions and critical paths identified in the codebase audit.

### Key Files
- `src/lib/processors/detect.ts` - Source type detection (pure function, easy to test)
- `src/lib/security.ts` - Auth utilities (critical security path)
- `docs/reviews/2026-01-25-codebase-review.md` - Full audit with recommendations

### Kickoff Message
LazyList v0.1 now supports TikTok, GitHub, and X/Twitter sources with delete/edit UI. Codebase audit shows strong security (A-) and type safety (A) but zero test coverage (F). Priority: install Vitest, add tests for detect.ts and security.ts. See audit report at docs/reviews/2026-01-25-codebase-review.md for full findings.
